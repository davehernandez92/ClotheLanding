 Responsive Clothing Landing Page

 I made this landing page using pure Css and javascript, I learned how to integrate scrollreveal and Swiper.

 For the Icons I used Remix Icons

Some features are: 

- Responsive Clothing Landing Page Using HTML CSS & JavaScript
- Contains animations when scrolling using Scrollreveal.js
- Smooth scrolling in each section.
- Developed first with the Mobile First methodology, then for desktop using BEM methodology.
- Compatible with all mobile devices even 2k and 4k screens and with a beautiful and pleasant user interface.
